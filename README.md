# Covid-Death-Case-Predictor
Through the concept of time series analysis, we will predict COVID-19 cases and deaths for the winter of 2022. In order to form these predictions, we used timelines and data of total cases per day and total deaths per day of the three highest and three lowest vaccinated states. Using libraries we were able to clean, create, and maximize the data to apply a forecasting model of cases and deaths for the last month of 2022. 
The data, collected from various states with their own data tracking methods, may contain missing values that could potentially skew the results, making the data susceptible to inaccuracy.

To view cases and deaths, the user will write the code following the methods in the code in accoradance to the state they want to compare, and if they want to view deaths or cases.
